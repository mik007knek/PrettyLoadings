This is PrettyLoadings lib by mik007knek, and it is almost the most useless lib!

Version = 0.0.0.1.2

Loadings:
-Text Expansion (t->te->tes->test)
-Symbol Expansion (%->%%->%%%->%%%%)
-Dot Circling ('-'->'\'->'|'->'/')
-Line Circling ('-'->'\\'->'|||'->'////')
-Owl Dancing

\) )\ -> /| |\ -> /( (/ -> /| |\
 / \      / \      / \      / \
(all examples are shown as 1 time loop)

In next versions there will be more loadings and (maybe) adaptive loadings
for tkinter and more!

Soon, I can (maybe not) upload this project to PyPi!

P. S.: In each func in console_load, you can see `clear: bool = False`. I used it for people who have macOS or Linux
P. S. 2: Sorry for my english, i don't know it very well, i'm from Russia)
